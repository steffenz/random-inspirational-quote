## About the quotes
Finding quotes was harder than writing the actual code, especially because picking just one from each person was extremly difficult. These quotes, and thus the persons who made them famous has had a real impact me, and I'd highly suggest you'd check some of their work out;

### Mark Manson
If you only have time for *one* self-help book this ~~year~~ century, [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713) is a great fit (and probably also a great gateway drug for more self-help books). Manson's sometimes edgy non-BS approach is refreshlingy good. We do, after all, have a limited amount of fucks to give, and need to spend them wisely (for fucks sake).

### Alfred Adler
Doctor, psychotherapist, and founder of [individual psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_psychology). Although he certainly had some controversial views, a lot of his work and thoughts still holds up very well today. I was first introduced to "Adlerian psychology" through [The Courage to Be Disliked](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274), which destills and boils many of his thoughts and theories down to more understandable form.

### Ichiro Kishimi
Philosopher which writes and lectures on Adlerian psychology and provides counseling for youths in psychiatric clinics as a certified counselor and consultant for the Japanese Society of Adlerian Psychology. Author of [The Courage to Be Disliked](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274) (where the quote is picked from), together with Fumitake Koga.

### Jim Carrey
Famous actor and entertainer which in recent years has been open about mental health issues. To me, he's a great example of somebody who always give to everybody at the expense of himself. This painfully insightful quote was given [during an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqria9jU9A).

### Eckhart Tolle
Reading [The Power of Now](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808/) originally was something I was rather opposed to, because I was afraid it would severly alter my established views and way of thinking. However, a whole lot of it turned out to make a great deal of sense to me once I properly dared taking it into consideration. Accepting things for what they are, realizing what you cannot change, and seperating yourself from your thoughts and mind is actually rather liberating and calming. 

### Porter Robinson
Artist whose work and general wholesomeness soothes, inspires and reminds me to contribute to this world something that will outlast me, and never to give up. Quote was fetched form the video description of [Look at the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJBh_hj6DzE) on YouTube. Be sure to also check out his [website](https://porterrobinson.com/) which features an very interesting experience (both artistic and techincally).
